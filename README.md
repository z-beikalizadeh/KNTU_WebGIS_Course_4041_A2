## Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript and the Fetch API

### What is Asynchronous Programming?

**Asynchronous programming** allows your code to perform tasks without blocking the execution of other code. In web development, this is crucial when making network requests (like API calls) because:

- Network requests can take time to complete
- You don't want to freeze the entire webpage while waiting for a response
- Users can continue interacting with your application while data loads in the background

### JavaScript Promises

A **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. A Promise can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The operation is still in progress
- **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully
- **Rejected**: The operation failed

### The Fetch API

The **Fetch API** is a modern JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple, promise-based way to fetch resources from the network.

#### Basic Fetch Syntax

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    // Handle the data
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```

#### How Fetch Works

1. **`fetch(url)`** - Initiates a network request to the specified URL
2. **`.then(response => response.json())`** - Processes the response and converts it to JSON
3. **`.then(data => {...})`** - Handles the parsed data
4. **`.catch(error => {...})`** - Handles any errors that occur

### Using Async/Await

**Async/await** is a modern syntax that makes asynchronous code easier to read and write. It's built on top of Promises.

#### Async/Await Syntax

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    // Handle the data
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}
```

#### Key Concepts

- **`async`** - Declares a function as asynchronous
- **`await`** - Pauses execution until the Promise resolves
- **`try/catch`** - Handles both success and error cases

### Fetch API in This Assignment

In this assignment, you will use the Fetch API to:

1. **Geocoding Requests** (Part 1):

   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching coordinates from a geocoding API
   const response = await fetch(
     `https://api.example.com/geocode?address=${searchTerm}`
   );
   const data = await response.json();
   const coordinates = [data.longitude, data.latitude];
   ```

2. **Weather Data Requests** (Part 2):
   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching weather data for coordinates
   const response = await fetch(
     `https://api.example.com/weather?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}`
   );
   const data = await response.json();
   // Display weather information
   ```

### Error Handling

Always handle potential errors when using fetch:

```javascript
async function fetchWithErrorHandling(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);

    // Check if the response is OK (status 200-299)
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    // Show user-friendly error message
    alert("Failed to fetch data. Please try again.");
  }
}
```

5. Submit the link to your forked repository upon completion

## Assignment Structure

This assignment is divided into **two parts**:

---

## Part 1: Interactive Map with Geocoding Search

### Requirements

1. **Create a map using OpenLayers library**

   - Initialize an OpenLayers map with a base layer (e.g., OSM, Bing Maps, or any tile layer)
   - Set an appropriate initial view (center and zoom level)

2. **Add a search bar**

   - Place a search input field at the top of the map
   - Include a search button next to the input field

3. **Implement geocoding functionality**

   - When the user clicks the search button:
     - Use the `fetch` API to request geocoding services (OpenMapQuest or other geocoding APIs)
     - Parse the response to extract coordinates (latitude and longitude)
     - Animate the map to zoom to the found location using OpenLayers animation features
   - Handle errors appropriately (e.g., location not found, API errors)

4. **Documentation**
   - Add a section in your README explaining all the OpenLayers features you used for creating the map
   - Include descriptions of layers, views, controls, and animations

### Geocoding API

**Example: OpenMapQuest Geocoding API**

As an example, you can use **OpenMapQuest Geocoding API** for this assignment. You can find more information at: https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/

#### What is an API Key?

An **API Key** (Application Programming Interface Key) is a unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize requests to an API service. It acts like a password that:

- Identifies your application to the API provider
- Tracks your API usage for billing and rate limiting
- Provides security by restricting access to authorized users only
- Allows the provider to monitor and manage API access

#### How to Get an API Key

1. **Visit the API provider's website** (e.g., https://developer.mapquest.com/)
2. **Create an account** - Sign up for a free developer account
3. **Navigate to the API section** - Look for "Get API Key", "Create App", or "My Apps" section
4. **Generate your API key** - Follow the instructions to create a new API key
5. **Copy and store your API key securely** - Never commit API keys directly to public repositories. Use environment variables or configuration files that are excluded from version control (add them to `.gitignore`)

#### ⚠️ Important: API Key Security

**DO NOT put your API keys directly in your code files (index.html, script.js, etc.).**

- **Why?** API keys in code can be exposed if your repository is public, leading to unauthorized usage and potential charges
- **What to do instead:**
  - Use placeholder text in your code (e.g., `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`)
  - Store API keys in a separate configuration file that is excluded from version control
  - Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`
  - For this assignment, you can use a simple approach: hardcode with a placeholder and replace it locally when testing

**Submission:** When you submit your assignment link in VC, you must also submit your API keys separately through the VC system. Do not include API keys in your repository or README file.

**Your Task - API Research and Comparison:**

You are required to:

1. **Find at least 3 different geocoding APIs** - Research and discover geocoding APIs available online (you can use web search or AI tools)
2. **Research pricing information** for each API you find:
   - Free tier limits (if available)
   - Paid pricing structure
   - Rate limits
   - How to obtain an API key
   - Any other relevant details
3. **Compare the pricing** of at least 3 different geocoding APIs
4. **Calculate price ratios** between the APIs (e.g., "API A costs X times more than API B for the same number of requests")
5. **Provide your analysis** in your README including:
   - A comparison table with **all pricing information you found** and calculated ratios
   - Your reasoning for choosing a specific API for this assignment
   - Justification based on pricing, free tier limits, and features
6. **Document your choice** - Explain why you selected the API you're using in your project

**Note**: You are free to use AI tools or web search to find and gather information about geocoding APIs. Make sure to verify information from official sources.

   - When a user clicks on a point on the map:
     - Use the `fetch` API to request weather data for the clicked coordinates
     - Find and use a suitable weather API (see section below)

3. **Display weather information**
   - Create a div element to display weather data
   - Show the div on the map (you can position it as an overlay or in a corner)
   - Display relevant weather information (temperature, conditions, humidity, etc.)
   - Handle loading states and errors appropriately

### Weather API

**Example: OpenWeatherMap API**

As an example, you can use **OpenWeatherMap API** for this assignment. You can find more information at: https://openweathermap.org/api
